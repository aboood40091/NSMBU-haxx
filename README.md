# NSMBU-haxx
A compilation of code hacks for NSMBU. Also an example for the [CafeLoader Project Compiler](https://github.com/aboood40091/CafeLoader-Project-Compiler) ([cemu branch](https://github.com/aboood40091/CafeLoader-Project-Compiler/tree/cemu) is needed for building for cemu).

## Current haxx:
* Custom music list  
* Space physics as area option (wrapByte & 2)  
* Magic Platform sprite (Replaces actor "Cookie". Check magicplatform.h for settings for this sprite.)  
* Flip block sprite (Replaces actor "Giant4WayCannon". Currently uses the Snake Block model.)

## Special Thanks:
* [Kinnay](https://github.com/Kinnay): many structures and permission to use said structures. Help with debugging.
