# NSMBU-haxx
A compilation of code hacks for NSMBU. Also an example for the [CafeLoader Project Compiler](https://github.com/aboood40091/CafeLoader-Project-Compiler) ([cemu branch](https://github.com/aboood40091/CafeLoader-Project-Compiler/tree/cemu) is needed for building for cemu).

## Current haxx:
* Custom music list  
* Space physics as area option (Area data "wrapByte & 2")  
* Actor Spawner sprite (Sprite 724.)  
* Flip Block sprite (Sprite 725. Currently uses the Snake Block model.)  
* Magic Platform sprite (Sprite 726.)  

## Credits:
* [RicBent](https://github.com/RicBent/codedx): Contribution to headers, original Actor Spawner and basic Magic Platform implementations  
* Modified dynamic_libs to work with this project, based on original implementation by dimok and [Maschell fork](https://github.com/Maschell/dynamic_libs)
