# NSMBU-haxx
A compilation of code hacks for NSMBU. Also an example for the CafeLoader Project Compiler.

## Current haxx:
* Custom music list  
* Space physics as area option (wrapByte & 2)  
* Magic Platform sprite (Replaces actor "Cookie". Check magicplatform.h for settings for this sprite.)  
* Flip block sprite (Replaces actor "Giant4WayCannon". Currently uses the Snake Block model.)

## Special Thanks:
* Kinnay: many structures and permission to use said structures. Help with debugging.
