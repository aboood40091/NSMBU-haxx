# NSMBU-haxx
A compilation of code hacks for NSMBU. Also an example for the [CafeLoader Project Compiler](https://github.com/aboood40091/CafeLoader-Project-Compiler) ([cemu branch](https://github.com/aboood40091/CafeLoader-Project-Compiler/tree/cemu) is needed for building for cemu).

## Current haxx:
* Custom music list  
* Space physics as area option (Area data "wrapByte & 2")  
* Flip Block sprite (Replaces profile "Giant4WayCannon", AKA sprite 178. Currently uses the Snake Block model.)
* Magic Platform sprite (Replaces profile "Cookie", AKA sprite 538.)
